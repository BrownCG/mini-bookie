Mini-Bookie

Introduction
For my school portfolio project, I wanted to create the backend for a basic sports-betting software demonstrating the basics of how bookmakers’ set head to head odds. It demonstrates the basics of how odds get adjusted in real time according to the flow of money into a sportsbook. I wanted to create such an application to have an interactive tool for teaching the workings of sportsbooks to new bettors, as well as allowing a tool for easily testing “paper-trading” strategies or fantasy sports-style competition between friends.
